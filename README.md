# SimpleCRM

Simple CRM project with:

- Java 9
- Spring boot 2
- Hibernate ORM
- Lombok
- Spring Web
- Spring MVC
- RESTful (maybe, I don't know) 
- some other interesting things

How to:
  - open annotation.property and change DB parameters to yours;
  - make shure that DB user you log in with have permission to create tables in selected DB "public" schema;
  - mvn clean install;
  - enjoy.

import.sql file has test data to refill empty DB table. If you do not want use it - just delete this file before build.
Make shure you use option mvn clean before mvn install.
